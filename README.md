SnowBrain is an open-source prototype that serves as your personal data analyst. It converses in SQL, remembers previous discussions, and even draws data visualizations for you.

This project is a unique blend of Snowflake, Langchain, OpenAI, Pinecone, NEXTjs, and FastAPI, among other technologies. It's all about reimagining the simplicity of SQL querying. Dive in and discover a new way of interacting with your data.

## Features

- **Snowflake to Vector Database**: Automatic conversion of all Snowflake DDL to a vector database.
- **Conversational Memory**: Maintain context and improve the quality of interactions.
- **Snowflake Integration**: Integrate with Snowflake schema for automatic SQL generation and visualization.
- **Pinecone Vector Database**: Leverage Pinecone's vector database management system for efficient searching capabilities.
- **Secure Authentication**: Employ Clerk.dev for secure and hassle-free user authentication.
- **Rate Limit Handling**: Utilize Upstash Redis for managing rate limits.
- **Fast API**: High-performance Python web framework for building APIs.

## Example Queries

snowBrain is designed to make complex data querying simple. Here are some example queries you can try:

- **Total revenue per product category**: "Show me the total revenue for each product category."
- **Top customers by sales**: "Who are the top 10 customers by sales?"
- **Average order value per region**: "What is the average order value for each region?"
- **Order volume**: "How many orders were placed last week?"
- **Product price listing**: "Display the list of products with their prices."

## Installation

Follow these steps to get **snowBrain** up and running in your local environment.

1. **Update Environment Variables**

    Make sure to update the environment variables as necessary. Refer to the example provided:

    ```bash
    .env.example
    ```

2. **Auto fetch All Schema DDL**

    You can do this by running the following command:

    ```bash
    python embed/snowflake_ddl_fetcher.py
    ```

3. **Convert DDL Documents to Vector & Upload to Pinecone**

    Use the following command to do this:

    ```bash
    python embed/embed.py
    ```

4. **Install Dependencies for the Code Plugin**

    Navigate to the code plugin directory and install the necessary dependencies using Poetry:

    ```bash
    cd code-plugin && poetry install
    ```

5. **Deploy FastAPI to Modal Labs**

    Run the following command to deploy your FastAPI (make sure to add a secrets file in modal labs):

    ```bash
    modal deploy main.py
    ```

    After deploying, make sure to store the endpoint in your environment variables:

    ```bash
    MODAL_API_ENDPOINT=
    MODAL_AUTH_TOKEN=random_secret
    ```

6. **Install packages**

    Install packages using the following command:

    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

7. **Run Locally**

    Test the setup locally using the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

8. **Deploy to Vercel**

    Finally, when you're ready, deploy the project to Vercel.
